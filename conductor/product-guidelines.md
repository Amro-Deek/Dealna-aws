# Product Guidelines

## 1. Core Principles
- **Trustworthy:** Our platform is built on a foundation of security and verification. All design and communication should reinforce a sense of safety and reliability.
- **Community-Focused:** The app is a closed environment for the university community. The user experience should be inclusive, respectful, and tailored to student life.
- **Simplicity:** The application must be intuitive and easy to use. Users should be able to accomplish their goals with minimal friction.

## 2. Prose Style & Tone of Voice
- **Clear & Concise:** All text within the application—from button labels to notifications and error messages—should be direct, simple, and easy to understand. Avoid jargon and overly complex language. The goal is to communicate information efficiently and unambiguously.

## 3. Visual Identity
- **UI/UX:** The user interface will be **Modern & Minimalist**.
    - **Layouts:** Clean, uncluttered, and focused on the core functionality. Use ample white space to create a breathable and organized interface.
    - **Navigation:** Must be intuitive and predictable. Users should be able to navigate the app with ease and always know where they are.
    - **Color Palette:** A simple and clean color palette should be used. Primary colors should be neutral, with accent colors used sparingly to highlight key actions and information. Consider using the university's official colors for branding accents.
    - **Typography:** Fonts must be modern, legible, and accessible. Sans-serif fonts are preferred for their readability on mobile screens.
    - **Iconography:** Icons should be simple, universally recognizable, and consistent in style throughout the application.
